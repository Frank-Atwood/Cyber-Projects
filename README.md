# Cyber-Projects
Welcome to my cybersecurity project portfolio!

My repository contains hands-on labs and projects that I've completed in my free time to strengthen my skills!

Each project includes objectives, tools used, methodology, screenshots, and key takeaways.

I'm currently a Senior at Appalachian State University! I will be graduating in the Fall 2026, and I will be graduating with a BS in Cybersecurity. 
Some of my courses that I've taken in my time at App State are; Managing Securities, Programming Software Solutions, Audit &
Cybersecurity Analytics, Global IS Ethics & Privacy, Database Management & Network and IT Infrastructures. 

Alongside my coursework I've completed a few certifications, I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Course [https://www.credly.com/badges/361ec408-3042-47ac-ad08-a38dcceceff0/linked_in_profile](url)

I also competed in the Microsoft Security Immersion Challenge hosted on our campus by Microsoft! [(https://www.credly.com/badges/50603db3-9582-46cb-bac2-510c478ca2e4/public_url)](url)

Finally I'm also in the process of completing the ISC2 CC Certification, with hopes to finish it sometime around Summer 2026. [https://www.credly.com/badges/0daf058e-c3ba-4cc9-b617-93e39b3c8e5c/public_url](url)

## How to Navigate 
I will continue to update folders with new projects as I complete them! As for now, the folder "Ethical Hacking (Class) PPTs" contains powerpoints that I have made in my class for Ethical Hacking! We touch a wide variety of topics that span from actual hacking, to prevention. I document the activity on a powerpoint for everyone to see!
